## Random thoughts
Well, I don't know where to begin really

I'm currently listening to a random YouTube playlist called " you’re writing love letters in an ancient library during autumn ".

It's a playlist of classical songs with rain on the background, and it made me think, what if I start writing my thoughts down too?

I thought it would be easier to write things down, but now that I am actually doing it, I have newfound respect for those who actually do it.

There are like hundreds and hundreds of different things I am currently navigating in my mind, and I am contemplating how much of it is actually worth sharing.

Events I'd like to talk about, people I am thinking of, or even how I have been sick for the last few days are all things that have crossed my mind, but none of them feel right.

At least the playlist is good enough to keep me thinking about certain things, like the smile of my friends, the shared echoes of laughter or even the activities that we've done.
