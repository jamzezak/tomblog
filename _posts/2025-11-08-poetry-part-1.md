## Poetry Part 1 - Finished Projects



In the desolate corridors of my mind, I find myself navigating the intricate memories of our shared moments.

Each step I take resonates with a familiar echo of the laugh and jokes we've made

Every night after you fall asleep and the darkness takes you away from me

I take a pilgrimage to this quiet sanctuary, where our every moment spent becomes the very essence of us. 

Within the delicacies of our imperfections, I've found myself a Rome

A city not built on grandiose or luxuries, but on the genuine beauty of our vulnerabilities

It is a city in which you are the sole architect, and your vision is far beyond what I, myself, am capable of

It is a testament to the authenticity of our connection, something so grand, yet fragile.


I wish I could tell you that all my bewildered roads lead to the station that is you.

I am a weary traveller longing to travel through the very geography that is you

The unexplored roads of your body, a landscape so beautiful yet veiled in mystery

How can it take my breath away yet leave me longing for more? Is it the magnetic pull of your presence?


Within the confines of a truth that we refuse to acknowledge lies the absurdity of human emotion

Some people would parallel that to being naked in the eyes of the wrong person

A horrifying and distressing feeling that feels so comfortable to me, if it's you.


# Poem #2

I walked towards an uncertainty, heart racing with every step taken

Your sun-kissed skin glowing in the distant light

Your smile serving as my guiding light

Waves of silence crashed upon the busy intersection

Everything around seemed to fade until there was only us

The silence spoke louder than we ever could

Until I held you.

You felt like a feather in my arms

Light, fragile, soft to the touch

If you were to slip away from me, I'd still be reaching.

I shouldn't have held you in my arms that night.
