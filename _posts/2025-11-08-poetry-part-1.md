## Poetry Part 1

Since I have no clear direction of what I want to write, I will instead share some of the poetry I have written over the last 2 weeks to 3 months.

In the desolate corridors of my mind, I find myself navigating the intricate memories of our shared moments.
Each step I take resonates with a familiar echo of the laugh and jokes we've made
Every night after you fall asleep and the darkness takes you away from me
I take a pilgrimage to this quiet sanctuary, where our every moment spent becomes the very essence of us. 

Within the delicacies of our imperfections, I've found myself a Rome
A city not built on grandiose or luxuries, but on the genuine beauty of our vulnerabilities
It is a city in which you are the sole architect, and your vision is far beyond what I, myself, am capable of
It is a testament to the authenticity of our connection, something so grand, yet fragile.

I wish I could tell you that all my bewildered roads lead to the station that is you.
I am a weary traveller longing to travel through the very geography that is you
The unexplored roads of your body, a landscape so beautiful yet veiled in mystery
How can it take my breath away yet leave me longing for more? Is it the magnetic pull of your presence?

Within the confines of a truth that we refuse to acknowledge lies the absurdity of human emotion
Some people would parallel that to being naked in the eyes of the wrong person
A horrifying and distressing feeling that feels so comfortable to me, if it's you.
